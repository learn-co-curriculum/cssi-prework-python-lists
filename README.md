#Python Lists and Loops

#Objectives:
* Create a list using Python syntax
* Create `for` loops and `while` loops using Python syntax

#Motivation:
In this lesson you will learn how to create Python's version of an array, a **list**. You will also learn how to use loops in your Python code in order to manipulate or use the elements in that list.

Code-along with this readme in the Python console. To access the console, type 'python' into the command line. When you're finished, exit by typing 'quit()'

#Lists in Python
A list is the most basic Python data structure. It is a list of objects or values. The syntax for a list is the same as the syntax for an array in JavaScript: a set of objects enclosed in brackets.  

To create an empty list, set a variable equal to empty brackets:
```
>>> empty_list = []
```
To create a list with some elements in it, just add the elements separated by commas:
```
>>> groceries = ['Eggs', 'Milk','Kale']
```
###Accessing List Items
List items have an index and are accessed using bracket notation. Just like in JavaScript, indexing starts at 0:

```
>>> groceries[0]
'Eggs'
>>> groceries[1]
'Milk'
>>> groceries[0:2]
['Eggs', 'Milk']
>>> groceries[1:]
['Milk', 'Kale']
```

###Modifying a List
The easiest way to modify a listâ€™s content is to just access the list element by its index (numerical place in the list) and use the assignment operator. Lists are mutable, which means a list can be changed without being recreated. 
```
>>> groceries
['Eggs', 'Milk','Kale']
>>> groceries[0] = 'Bread'
>>> groceries
['Bread', 'Milk', 'Kale']
```

###Methods to Modify Lists

You can also modify lists using certain list-specific methods. 

The append method allows you to stick an element at the end of a list. Note that `append()` only takes one argument.
```
>>> groceries.append('Asparagus')
>>> groceries
['Bread', 'Milk', 'Kale', 'Asparagus']
```

To add more than one element to an existing list, you can use `extend()` which will concatenate lists together.
```
groceries.extend(['Rutabaga', 'Ice Cream'])
['Bread', 'Milk', 'Kale', 'Asparagus','Rutabaga', 'Ice Cream']
```

You can use `del` to remove an element at a specific index.
```
del groceries[3] #removes 'Asparagus' from the list
['Bread', 'Milk', 'Kale','Rutabaga', 'Ice Cream']
```
If you know the value that you'd like removed, you can use `remove()` which looks for the first matching value and removes it from a list.

```
groceries.remove('Rutabaga')
['Bread','Milk','Kale','Ice Cream']
```

To order a list alphabetically or numerically use sort()
```
groceries.sort()
['Bread', 'Ice Cream', 'Kale', 'Milk']
```


Finally, the `len()` function, you can return the number of items in a list:
```
print len(groceries)
3
```

### 'In' and 'Not' Operators

You can use 'in' to check the condition that a value exists within a list.
```python
if 'Kale' in groceries:
  print "Thank gosh we're not missing out on this super food."
else:
  print 'Buy all the kale!'
```
To check if an element is absent from a list, use the 'not' in operator:
```python
if 'Milk' not in groceries:
  print "Don't forget the milk"
```

###Using range() to Build Lists
In testing a script, you might want to quickly generate a list of numbers. Rather than have you type out all the numbers you want, Python makes this easy with 'range()'. The syntax is `range(<start_int>, <end_int>, <interval>)` where the interval is an optional parameter and defaults to 1.

```
range(0,10)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
range(0,100,10)
[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
```
